No api/gas.js added. Android not modified.
KM service worker updated to network-first navigation to avoid stale index.html.

Deployment: Upload these files to the existing KM Vercel project, retaining root-level paths. Redeploy, then reload browser with DevTools Disable cache enabled. In Application > Service Workers, unregister the old worker if needed. Confirm Network requests use the current backend IDs.

Note: These uploaded source files already contain the migrated URLs. This package does not change backend authentication logic. Verify deployment and browser cache; live functionality not verified.

Changed files: service-worker.js
